# Madlibs Project

Find a Madlibs template online and create a Madlibs generator using Java. You could also use ChatGPT or something simliar to make the Madlib. Obviously not to do the coding though.

Criteria:
* Must use variables and the Scanner class
* Must take user’s name
* Must take date using integers (think month first, then day, then year)
* Print the madlib at the end with the user’s name and date at the top.
* Feel free to add some formatting to make it fancy looking.
